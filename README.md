This is the data service application for the CS 262 MindfulKnight project, that runs the client which is deployed here:

https://mindfulknights.azurewebsites.net/
It has the following data route URLs:

/ a hello message

/users a list of users

/users/:username a single player with the given ID

It is based on the standard Azure App Service tutorial for Node.js.

The database is relational with the schema specified in the sql/ sub-directory and is hosted on ElephantSQL. The database server, user and password are stored as Azure application settings so that they arenâ€™t exposed in this (public) repo.
